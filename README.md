The first homework request me to learn HTML and CSS, use git bash.


## 1: Setip
I took this course last year, so I already have git in my computer, but I sign up a new account for GitHub. 

At first, I create a file named README
```
git init
git add README.md 
git commit -m "First commit."
```
Then, I got a remote control for pushing something to my GitHub

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/chunzel16/chunzel16.github.io.git
git remote -v 
origin  https://github.com/chunzel16/chunzel16.github.io.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/chunzel16/chunzel16.github.io.git (push)
```
Then I can push my file to website
